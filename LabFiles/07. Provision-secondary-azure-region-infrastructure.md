# Exercise 6:  Provision Secondary Azure Region Infrastructure 
 
 Duration: 20-30 mins
 
 ## Scenario
 
 Contoso Application is growing in popularity around the world, so they need a supporting infrastructure for the application. Contoso wants the network resources in the primary and secondary regions to communicate securely over a private network.

 In this section, you will help Contoso in setting up secondary region infrastructure and configure network peering that allows resources in primary and secondary to communicate securely on a private network.
 
 ## Overview
 

Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's private network only. To learn more about Vnet peering refer to: ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview```
 
 In this exercise, you'll create a Virtual Network in a secondary region and deploy a VM within the Vnet. You'll also configure Peering connections between the Vnets and test inter-VM connectivity on your private network.

     - Username: **demouser**

     - Password: **Password.1!!**

1. If you are asked with a dialogue box after entering your credentials, select **Yes**.

1. Now, from your Azure Portal navigate to the resource group **rg-contoso-prod-eastus** and select the private IP Address of **vm-contoso-app-prod-eastus-002** from the overview page

1. Minimize the RDP and navigate to azure portal.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/minrdp.png?raw=true)

1. Now, from your Azure Portal navigate to the resource group **rg-contoso-prod-eastus** and select private IP Address of **vm-contoso-app-prod-eastus-002** from the overview page

   ![privateip](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/privateipa.png?raw=true)
     
1. Now, inside the **<inject key="samplevm" enableCopy="false"/>** type **powershell (1)** and select **Windows PowerShell (2)**.

   ![rdp](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/pping2.png?raw=true)

   ```
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.1.0.5 -Port 3389 -InformationLevel 'Detailed'
   ```
   ![private](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/pping3.png?raw=true)

1. Examine the output of the command and verify that the connection was successful. This represents you've successfully set up inter-VM connectivity on your private network.


### Summary

In this exercise you have covered the following:

- Setup Virtual Network in a secondary region
- Deployed Virtual Machine in secondary VNet
- Created peering between primary and Virtual Network
- Tested intersite connectivity
