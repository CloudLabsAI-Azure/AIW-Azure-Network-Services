### Azure Networking Solutions

### Overview

Contoso Insurance Company has been in business for over 20 years and is a well-known and respected brand name in the Insurance industry. They are historically risk-averse, and it has served them well, enabling them to avoid several financial storms that closed the doors on similarly sized institutions. While Contoso started in Miami United States, around 20 years ago, they have started their new branch in Florida city around 10 years ago. 

Contoso Insurance has placed both offices in different networks and connected the networks to each other using VNet peering to communicate between the branches and access the resources vice-versa. Also, they have set up an availability zone on their headquarter servers to give 100 percent availability to their Users. They have set up a Load Balancer to maintain the load between the servers and switch whenever required. 

Contoso Insurance Company has set up the application gateway to connect with the Servers because of safety concerns and they have set up an Azure Firewall with a Firewall policy on the application gateway to keep the servers safe from attackers.

### Hands-on Labs Scenario

Contoso Insurance is a well-known brand in the industry. They are planning to launch a new Contoso Insurance portal in the market to start providing their insurance services online. Their development team has already developed the portal. They are all set to launch their new Contoso Insurance portal. Before they launch it, they want to get it tested by internal and beta users. To start testing the application they have chosen Azure as their cloud platform as Azure offers a massive range of IaaS facilities required for any business like compute, networking, storage, security, and much more.

Contoso wants to host their Contoso Insurance application on a server that provides more control and flexibility over the computing environment. They want their application to be highly available and want to control the system failures with zero downtime. As Contoso is planning to make their application available for a wider audience, they want their application to be highly secure and meet all security guidelines and also have a monitoring solution.

They need your help to configure the infrastructure and deploy their developed application. You need to choose the right approach to set up and deploy their Insurance application on Azure as per the end state Architecture given below. However, you will be doing it in phases as the development and testing progress. In the end Infrastructure of the required Azure resources for the Contoso Insurance Application must look the same as below end-state Architecture.

### Solution Architecture

Below is the diagram of the end-stage solution architecture you will build in this lab. You'll build it in phases as development and testing progress.

### Lab Context

In this workshop, you will learn how to setup and configure a virtual network with subnets in Azure. You will deploy a pre-configured IaaS environment then redesign and update it to account for high availability with the help of Azure Load balancer. You will provision Virtual Network in a secondary region and deploy a virtual machine within the Vnet. You'll also configure Peering connections between the Virtual Networks and test inter-site Virtual Machine connectivity on your private network.

You will learn how to enhance the security of your application with the help of Azure application gateway (WAF) and Azure Firewall. You will configure User-defined route (UDR) and outbound traffic to go via Azure Firewall. You will enable Network Watcher and utilize tools to monitor, troubleshoot, view metrics, and enable logs for resources in your Azure virtual network.
 

## Exercise 1: Getting Started with Azure 

In this exercise, you will log in to the Azure Portal and review the pre-deployed resource groups that are deployed as part of the lab environment.

## Exercise 2: Provision Network Landing Zone

In this exercise, you'll create a Virtual Network and subnets for different scenarios like AVD, DMZ, Internal, and AzureFirewallSubnet.

## Exercise 3: Provision Contoso Insurance Application in Existing Network

In this exercise, you will deploy a Virtual Machine using a pre-built ARM template, create a Public IP address and associate it to the Virtual Machine. Then you'll create a network security group, add rules to allow outbound traffic, and associate it with the virtual machine's network interface. You will then test the Contoso Insurance application.

## Exercise 4:  Setup Load Balancing 

In this exercise, you will provision a secondary Virtual Machine with the Contoso Insurance application hosted on it. You will deploy an external Load Balancer, place Virtual Machines in the backend pool and check the load balancing between virtual machines. You will also test the behavior of the load balancer in case of VM failover.

## Exercise 5: Provision & Configure Azure Firewall & Application Gateway

In this exercise, you will deploy a Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF then you will publish an application through them. You'll also test the application for security and perform a sample attack, and also you'll configure UDR and outbound traffic to go via Azure Firewall.

## Exercise 6: Provision Secondary Azure Region Infrastructure

In this exercise, you'll create a Virtual Network in a secondary region and deploy a VM within the Vnet. You'll also configure Peering connections between the Vnets and test inter-VM connectivity on your private network.

## Exercise 7: Monitoring Azure Network

In this exercise, you will enable a Network Watcher and create Flow Logs to run Sample traffic and perform Sample network troubleshooting. You'll also deploy Log Analytics Workspace and Network Monitoring Solution to set up Azure Monitor Alerts and test notifications.
