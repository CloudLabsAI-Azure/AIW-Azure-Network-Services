# Exercise 3: Provision Contoso Insurance Application in Existing Network

Duration: 60-70 mins

## Scenario

Now that Contoso has their network ready, they want to host their Contoso Insurance application on a server that provides more control and flexibility over the computing environment. Contoso wants to provide their hosted application to internal users for testing.

To help Contoso, you will deploy an Azure Virtual Machine with Contoso Insurance application hosted on it, you will also test the application internally by browsing the Public IP address of the Virtual Machine.

## Overview

In this exercise, you will deploy a Virtual Machine using a pre-built ARM template, create a Public IP address and associate it to the Virtual Machine. Then you'll create a Network Security Group, add rules to allow inbound traffic, and associate it with the Virtual Machine's Network Interface. You will then test the Contoso Insurance application.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* [Task 1: Deploy VM using pre-built ARM Template in existing network](#task-1-deploy-vm-using-pre-built-arm-template-in-the-existing-network)

* [Task 2: Add Public IP to the virtual machine](#task-2-add-public-ip-to-the-virtual-machine)

* [Task 3: Configure NSGs and allow Application Access](#task-3-configure-nsgs-and-allow-application-access)

* [Task 4: Test Application](#task-4-test-application) 


## Task 1: Deploy VM using pre-built ARM Template in the existing network. 

In this task, you will deploy a virtual machine without public IP address using a pre-built ARM template.

1. Copy and paste the below **Link** in the new tab of your browser and launch the template deployment.  Log in to the Azure portal using your credentials if you are prompted to do so.

    ```
    https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCloudLabsAI-Azure%2FAIW-Azure-Network-Solutions%2Fmain%2Ftemplate%2Fcontoso-iaas-region1.json
    ```
    
1. Select the  Resource group **rg-contoso-prod-eastus (1)** from drop-downlist and click on **Review + create (2)**.

      ![template deployment](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/r+d.png?raw=true)
      
1. Review the template and select **Create**. 

    ![template deployment](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/vmcreate3.png?raw=true)
    
1. While you wait for the resources to deploy, take some time to review the template content. Navigate to **Templates** and observe the resources which are deploying.

   > The template is designed to deploy a virtual machine in the Availability zone for high availability

    ![template](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/template.png?raw=true)
      
1. Navigate back to the **Overview** tab and click **Go to resource group** after the template has been successfully created.
   
   > **Note**: The template will take up to 15 minutes to deploy.

## Task 2: Add Public IP to the virtual machine

In the previous task, you have deployed a Virtual machine with a Contoso web application hosted on it, now for the users to access the Contoso application, a Public IP is needed. In this task, you will create and associate the Public IP Address to the Virtual Machines Network Interface.

1. Navigate to the resource group **<inject key="Resource Group" enableCopy="false"/>** and from  the **Overview (1)** tab  select the virtual machine **<inject key="VM1Name" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.

   ![vm1.1](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/prod1.png?raw=true)
   
1. On the Virtual machine **Overview** tab, you can observe that the virtual machine doesn't have a **Public IP address** associated. In the next steps, you will create a Public IP address and associate it to the Virtual Machines Network Interface.

   ![noIP](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/nopip.png?raw=true)
   
1. Navigate back to the **Azure Portal** home page by clicking on **Home**.

## Task 3: Configure NSGs and allow Application Access

Azure network security group helps to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol. To explore more about Network security groups, refer ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview```

In this task, you will create a Network Security Group, and add an inbound rule to allow inbound traffic for application access via Port 80(HTTP).

1. Type **network (1)** in the search box of the **Azure Portal** menu and select **Network security groups (2)**.

   ![NSG](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/networksecurity.png?raw=true)
   
1. Click on **+ Create**.

    ![nsg create](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/nsg1.png?raw=true)
   
1. On the **Basics** tab of  Create network security group enter the following information:

   - Resource Group : Select your resource group **<inject key="Resource Group" enableCopy="false"/> (1)**

   - Name : **<inject key="nsg" enableCopy="true"/> (2)**.

   - Select **Review + create (3)**

   ![NSG](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/nsgnew.png?raw=true)
   
1. Review the configuration and click on **Create**.
